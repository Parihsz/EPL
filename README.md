# Luarihsz
Luarihsz is a programming language built with Lua. 

Syntax looks cursed because I thought combining Lua Python and Js syntax would be funny

# Language Basics

>### Creating Variables
```csharp

var name = "Parihsz"
global var age = 100

```

>### Referencing Variables
```js

print(name)
print(age)

```

>### Concatenating Strings
```js

var greeting = "Hello, {name}!"
print(greeting)

```

>### If Statements
```js

if age > 18 then
  print(`{name} is an adult.`)
end

```

>### Functions
```python

def greet(name)
  return `Hello, {name}!`
end

```

>### Loops
```js

for i in range(1, 11) do
  print(i)
end

var names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]

for name in names do
  print(name)
end
```
